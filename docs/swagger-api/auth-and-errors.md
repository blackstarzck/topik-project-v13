# Authentication, Headers, And Error Codes

[Back to Swagger API README](./README.md)

## Authentication Schemes

|Name|Type|In|Header|Scheme|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|BearerAuth|http|-|Authorization: Bearer <jwt>|bearer|JWT Bearer token. Dashboard tokens come from POST /api/eval/auth/login.|
|CampaignApiKey|apiKey|header|X-API-Key|-|Shared campaign API key for the /api/external/campaign/* endpoints.|

## Practical Header Examples

Bearer-authenticated endpoints:
```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```
External campaign endpoints:
```http
X-API-Key: <campaign_api_key>
```
JSON request endpoints:
```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Response And Error Code Index

|Status|Descriptions Seen In Swagger|
|---|---|
|200|Successful Response<br>Submission deleted<br>Assignee updated<br>Attachment image (or PDF) bytes<br>Submission claimed by caller<br>Edit saved<br>Submission invalidated<br>PDF file as an attachment<br>Source fields updated<br>New workflow status after transition<br>Translation saved<br>Current ARQ job status (with result when complete)<br>Eval run records from the SQLite eval database, optionally filtered by pipeline.<br>Individual test case results for the eval run, filtered by status.<br>Aggregate statistics for the eval run: pass rate, average score, distribution.<br>All admin reviews submitted for the target.<br>The created or updated review (upsert).<br>The current admin's review for the target, or `{}` if none submitted yet.<br>Run started. Returns the run_id to poll for status.<br>Current run status. Values: running, completed, failed, error.<br>High-level aggregate stats for the eval dashboard.<br>Full submission detail: essay text, task metadata, section scores, and feedback.<br>Paginated list of users who have at least one graded submission.<br>All graded writing submissions for the user, newest first.<br>Authenticated. Returns the user's JWT, refresh token, and profile.<br>Current status. `feedback`/scores populate once scored.<br>Audio binary stream (audio/mpeg).<br>Bookmark toggled; returns the new state.<br>Paginated submission history matching the filters.<br>Available question types for the requested TOPIK level.<br>Session created with all problems generated.<br>Current session state with its problems.<br>All submissions plus an aggregate summary for the session.<br>Answer graded; returns correctness, explanation, script, and XP.<br>Server-Sent Events stream (`text/event-stream`). Named events: `meta` (session_id + total_questions, sent first), `problem` (one per generated problem, WITHOUT audio so the FE renders the question immediately), `audio` (follow-up per problem carrying `audio_url` once TTS finishes; `audio_url` may be null on TTS failure), `error` (per-problem generation failure/timeout — stream continues), and `done` (terminal marker with `total_generated`). The `done` event always closes the stream.<br>New bookmark state for the problem.<br>AI-generated reading comprehension problem.<br>Paginated reading submission history, newest first.<br>All supported reading question types with labels and ranges.<br>Session created with all problems generated up front.<br>Current session state including all problems and progress index.<br>Final scored results for the session.<br>Answer graded within the session; returns correctness and progress.<br>Server-Sent Events stream (`text/event-stream`). Named events:<br>- `event: meta` — `{session_id, total_questions, status}` sent first.<br>- `event: problem` — one per generated problem: `{index, id, question_type, difficulty, passage, question, choices}`.<br>- `event: error` — `{index, message}` when a single problem fails or times out (stream continues with the next index).<br>- `event: done` — terminal marker: `{session_id, total_generated}`.<br>Answer graded; returns correctness, correct answer, explanation and XP.<br>Server-Sent Events stream (`text/event-stream`). Each event is `data: <partial text>` with embedded newlines escaped as `\n`; `: keep-alive` comments are sent periodically; the stream ends with `data: [DONE]`. Errors are delivered in-stream as `data: {"error": "..."}` before `[DONE]`.<br>PDF file download (feedback-{submission_id}.pdf).<br>Generated rich-metadata problem (review_status='검수 필요'); the body keys match the reference schema for the requested item_number.<br>Paginated submission history, newest first.<br>Submission deleted.<br>Draft saved; returns draft ID and character count.<br>Paginated list of available writing tasks.<br>Writing task from the database, or an AI-generated fallback.|
